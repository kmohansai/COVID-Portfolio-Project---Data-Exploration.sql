# COVID-Portfolio-Project---Data-Exploration.sql

**Technologies Used:** SQL (Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Views), Data Analysis

---

## Project Overview

This project explores COVID-19 datasets to analyze global trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.  
Key analyses include:

- Total cases vs total deaths by country
- Infection rate vs population
- Highest death counts per country and continent
- Population vaccinated analysis using rolling calculations
- Views and temp tables for simplifying complex calculations

The project demonstrates advanced SQL skills and a data-driven approach to healthcare analytics.

## Dataset

This project uses two datasets:

1. **COVID-19 Deaths Dataset** (`covid_deaths.csv`)  
   - Contains global COVID-19 death data with columns: `location`, `date`, `total_cases`, `new_cases`, `total_deaths`, `population`, `continent`.  
   - Original source: [AlexTheAnalyst Portfolio Project](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects)

2. **COVID-19 Vaccinations Dataset** (`covid_vaccinations.csv`)  
   - Contains vaccination data with columns: `location`, `date`, `new_vaccinations`.  
   - Original source: [AlexTheAnalyst Portfolio Project](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects)

> **Note:** Save these files in a `data/` folder in your repository.
